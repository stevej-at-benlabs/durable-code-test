## Overview
This document outlines the required GitHub branch protection rules to enforce code quality standards and ensure all code meets our durability requirements.

## Required Settings for `main` Branch

### 1. Navigate to Settings
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** → **Branches**
3. Click **Add rule** or edit existing rule for `main`

### 2. Branch Protection Rules

#### Basic Settings
- ✅ **Require a pull request before merging**
  - ✅ Require approvals: 1 (minimum)
  - ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
  - ✅ Require review from CODEOWNERS (if applicable)

#### Status Checks
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass before merging**
  - ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

  **Required status checks (must pass):**
  - `Python Code Quality`
  - `TypeScript/React Code Quality`
  - `Quality Gate Check`
  - `Code Coverage Analysis` (optional but recommended)

#### Conversation Resolution
- ✅ **Require conversation resolution before merging**

#### Additional Settings
- ✅ **Require signed commits** (optional but recommended)
- ✅ **Include administrators** (enforce rules for admins too)
- ✅ **Restrict who can push to matching branches** (optional)

### 3. Quality Gate Enforcement

The following checks MUST pass before any PR can be merged:

#### Python Requirements
- **Black**: Code formatting compliance
- **isort**: Import sorting compliance
- **Ruff**: Fast linting checks
- **Flake8**: Style guide adherence (max complexity: 5)
- **MyPy**: Type checking with strict mode
- **Bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Radon**: Complexity must be Grade A
- **Xenon**: All modules must maintain Grade A complexity

#### TypeScript/React Requirements
- **TypeScript**: Full compilation without errors
- **ESLint**: All rules must pass with 0 warnings
- **Prettier**: Code formatting compliance
- **Security**: No high or critical vulnerabilities

### 4. Manual Configuration Steps

After this PR is merged, please configure the branch protection rules:

```bash
# Using GitHub CLI (if you have appropriate permissions)
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["Python Code Quality","TypeScript/React Code Quality","Quality Gate Check"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":1,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null \
  --field allow_force_pushes=false \
  --field allow_deletions=false
```

### 5. Bypass Guidelines

**Emergency Bypass** (use sparingly):
- Only repository administrators can bypass
- Must document reason in PR description
- Should create follow-up issue to fix any bypassed checks

### 6. Local Pre-commit Checks

Developers should run these commands before pushing:

```bash
# Run all linting checks locally
make lint-all

# Auto-fix issues where possible
make lint-fix

# Check complexity ratings
make lint-complexity

# Run security checks
make lint-security
```

### 7. Monitoring and Metrics

Track these metrics monthly:
- Number of PRs blocked by quality gates
- Average complexity scores
- Security vulnerabilities found and fixed
- Code coverage trends

## Benefits of These Rules

1. **Code Durability**: Enforces complexity limit of A grade
2. **Consistency**: Automated formatting ensures uniform code style
3. **Type Safety**: Strict type checking prevents runtime errors
4. **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning
5. **Maintainability**: Low complexity ensures code is easy to understand
6. **Quality Gates**: Prevents low-quality code from entering main branch

## Troubleshooting

### If checks are failing:

1. **Run locally first**: `make lint-all`
2. **Auto-fix when possible**: `make lint-fix`
3. **Check complexity**: `make lint-complexity`
4. **Review specific tool output** in GitHub Actions logs

### Common issues:

- **Complexity too high**: Refactor into smaller functions
- **Type errors**: Add proper type annotations
- **Security issues**: Review Bandit output and fix vulnerabilities
- **Import order**: Run `poetry run isort .` or `npm run lint:fix`

## Contact

For questions about these rules or requesting exceptions, please:
1. Open an issue with the `quality-gate` label
2. Include justification for any exception requests
3. Tag the repository maintainers
