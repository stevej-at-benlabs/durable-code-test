"""
Purpose: Integration tests for FastAPI application
Scope: Testing full API integration with database
Overview: Comprehensive integration test suite that validates the FastAPI application's core functionality including endpoint accessibility, health checks, database connectivity, and proper environment configuration setup for CI/CD pipeline execution and deployment verification.
Dependencies: pytest, FastAPI test client, pathlib, os for environment variables
Exports: Integration test functions for API endpoints and database connectivity
Interfaces: pytest test functions with standard test patterns and CI environment checks
Implementation: Uses FastAPI TestClient with environment-based test skipping for CI integration
