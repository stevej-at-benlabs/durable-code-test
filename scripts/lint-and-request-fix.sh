# Purpose: Automated linting check for staged files with Claude assistance request
# Scope: Git-staged files validation and developer workflow integration
# Overview: Stages specified files, runs linting checks on staged content, and provides clear feedback to developers.
#           On linting failures, generates detailed instructions for Claude AI to fix the detected issues.
#           Designed for integration into development workflows and pre-commit processes.
# Dependencies: git, make (for lint-all-staged target)
# Usage: ./scripts/lint-and-request-fix.sh [FILE_PATH] (FILE_PATH is optional, stages current file if provided)
# Interfaces: Git staging area operations and make lint-all-staged command
# Implementation: Uses git add for staging, make for linting, and provides structured error reporting with exit codes

# Script to lint staged files and request Claude to fix any issues

cd /home/stevejackson/Projects/durable-code-test

# Stage the file that was just written/edited
git add "$1" 2>/dev/null

# Run linting on staged files
if make lint-all-staged 2>&1; then

    echo "Please:"
    echo "1. Review the linting errors shown above"
    echo "2. Fix each issue in the affected files"
    echo "3. Ensure the code follows project standards"
