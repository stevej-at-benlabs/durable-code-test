"""
Purpose: Demonstration of the new pluggable linter framework
Scope: Shows how the framework solves SOLID violations and enables extensibility
Overview: This demonstrates how the new pluggable architecture completely
    addresses the SOLID violations identified in the original analysis by
    providing proper separation of concerns, dependency injection, and
    extensible rule-based architecture.
Dependencies: Framework components and example rules
Exports: Demo functions showing framework capabilities
Interfaces: Uses framework public API
Implementation: Shows SOLID compliance through example usage
