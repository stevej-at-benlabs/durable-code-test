## üìù Completed PR Summaries

### PR1: TypeScript Configuration and Development Tooling
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Branch**: feature/pr1-typescript-configuration
**Key Commits**: [pending commit]

**What Was Done**:
- Enabled TypeScript strict mode with additional compiler options (noImplicitReturns, forceConsistentCasingInFileNames, esModuleInterop)
- Configured path aliases in tsconfig.app.json (@/, @components/, @features/, @hooks/, @services/, @utils/, @types/, @store/, @styles/)
- Updated Vite configuration to support path aliases for module resolution
- Enhanced ESLint configuration with TypeScript strict rules and React best practices
- Added "validate" script to package.json for comprehensive validation (typecheck + lint + test)
- Fixed all TypeScript strict mode errors (0 errors)
- Fixed all ESLint violations including:
  - Removed console.log statements from DemoTab.tsx
  - Fixed non-null assertion in main.tsx
  - Converted classes with only static methods to functions (UrlNormalizer, ValidationResultBuilder, DefaultExtractorFactory)
  - Fixed import sorting issues
- Fixed TypeScript errors in test files for proper type compatibility

**Deviations from Plan**:
- TypeScript strict mode was already enabled in the baseline, so no changes needed there
- Had to refactor utility classes with only static methods to functions due to ESLint strict rules
- Fixed additional TypeScript errors in test files that emerged during build

**New Files Created**:
- None

**Files Modified**:
- tsconfig.app.json (added compiler options and path aliases)
- vite.config.ts (added path alias configuration)
- eslint.config.js (enhanced with strict rules)
- package.json (added validate script)
- src/main.tsx (fixed non-null assertion)
- src/components/tabs/DemoTab.tsx (removed console.log, fixed useRef types)
- src/components/tabs/DemoTab.test.tsx (fixed TypeScript errors)
- src/utils/HttpRequestService.ts (converted static classes to functions)
- src/utils/LinkExtractionService.ts (converted static class to function)
- src/utils/LinkValidationService.ts (updated imports for refactored functions)
- Multiple files had import sorting fixed automatically

**Files Deleted**:
- None

**Tests**:
- All 88 tests passing
- Test files updated to fix TypeScript strict mode issues
- No new tests added (not required for configuration PR)

**Verification**:
- [x] App builds successfully
- [x] All tests pass (88 tests)
- [x] Linting passes (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] No console errors
- [x] All features still work (verified with make dev)
- [x] Performance not degraded
- [x] TypeScript strict mode enabled with 0 errors
- [x] Path aliases configured and working

**Notes for Next PR**:
- Path aliases are now available for cleaner imports
- TypeScript strict mode is enforced - all new code must comply
- Utility functions have been refactored from static classes
- ESLint is configured with strict rules - use npm run lint:fix for auto-fixes
- validate script available for full validation before commits

### PR2: State Management Foundation (Zustand + React Query)
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Branch**: feature/pr2-state-management-foundation
**Key Commits**: [pending commit]

**What Was Done**:
- Installed Zustand and @tanstack/react-query packages
- Created store directory structure at src/store/
- Implemented three Zustand stores:
  - appStore: Global app state (theme, loading, error states)
  - navigationStore: Tab navigation state with history tracking and URL sync
  - demoStore: WebSocket and oscilloscope state management
- Setup React Query with QueryClientProvider and ReactQueryDevtools
- Wrapped app with AppProviders component for React Query context
- Migrated tab state from local useState to navigationStore
- Maintained all existing functionality (URL hash sync, browser back/forward, return parameter)
- Exported TabName type from navigationStore for reuse

**Deviations from Plan**:
- Added navigateBack function to navigationStore for potential future use
- Included more comprehensive demo store state for WebSocket management
- TabName type definition moved to navigationStore instead of keeping in App.tsx

**New Files Created**:
- src/store/appStore.ts
- src/store/navigationStore.ts
- src/store/demoStore.ts
- src/store/index.ts
- src/app/AppProviders.tsx

**Files Modified**:
- src/main.tsx (wrapped app with AppProviders)
- src/App.tsx (migrated to use navigationStore)
- package.json (added new dependencies)
- package-lock.json (updated with new dependencies)

**Files Deleted**:
- None

**Tests**:
- All 88 tests passing
- No new tests added (state management will be tested in integration)
- Existing tests continue to work without modification

**Verification**:
- [x] App builds successfully
- [x] All tests pass (88 tests)
- [x] Linting passes (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] TypeScript strict mode (0 errors)
- [x] No console errors
- [x] All features still work
- [x] Tab navigation working
- [x] URL hash sync maintained
- [x] Browser back/forward working
- [x] React Query DevTools accessible

**Notes for Next PR**:
- Zustand stores are now available for state management
- React Query is ready for data fetching needs
- Navigation state is centralized and can be accessed from any component
- Consider using React Query for API calls in future PRs
- Demo store is ready for WebSocket state migration in PR5

**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Branch**: feature/pr3-common-components
**Key Commits**: 0f28570ea5bf29d123998f42e7b738549d262dd2

**What Was Done**:
- Created comprehensive common components library with 9 reusable components:
  - Button, Card, Tab, Icon, Link, Badge, LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, Section

- Fixed all TypeScript type imports to use type-only imports for strict compilation
- Implemented full accessibility features (ARIA attributes, semantic roles)
- Added CSS custom properties for consistent theming across components
- Created barrel export for clean component imports

**Deviations from Plan**:
- No significant deviations from the original plan
- All planned components were successfully implemented
- Component structure followed established patterns perfectly

**New Files Created**:
- src/components/common/ directory with 9 component subdirectories
- Each component has: Component.tsx, Component.types.ts, Component.module.css, Component.test.tsx, index.ts
- src/components/common/index.ts (barrel export file)

**Files Modified**:
- src/App.tsx (updated to use Tab and Icon components)
- src/App.test.tsx (updated for new components)
- src/components/tabs/DemoTab.tsx (updated to use Button components)

**Files Deleted**:
- None

**Tests**:
- Test coverage before: 88 tests
- Test coverage after: 179 tests (+91 new tests)
- New tests added: Comprehensive tests for all 9 common components
- All tests passing (100% success rate)

**Verification**:
- [x] App builds successfully
- [x] All tests pass (179 tests)
- [x] Linting passes (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] TypeScript strict mode (0 errors)
- [x] No console errors

**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Branch**: feature/pr4-infrastructure-feature
**Key Commits**: [pending commit]

- Added lazy loading with React.lazy() and Suspense for performance optimization
- Migrated from common Card component to original HTML structure for proper styling
- Fixed icon alignment from centered to left-aligned to match original design
- Implemented comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Used CSS Modules for component-scoped styling

**Deviations from Plan**:
- Initially tried to use common Card component but reverted to original HTML structure for compatibility
- Used relative imports instead of path aliases due to test environment limitations
- Fixed import sorting issues to comply with ESLint rules

**New Files Created**:
- src/features/infrastructure/types/infrastructure.types.ts
