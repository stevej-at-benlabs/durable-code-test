argument-hint: your question about the project

I'll answer your question about the Durable Code Test project using comprehensive project knowledge.

**CRITICAL: I will ALWAYS follow this exact order:**

1. **FIRST - Read Project Index**: I MUST read `.ai/index.json` BEFORE doing anything else. This provides the navigation map for the entire project.

2. **SECOND - Use Index to Navigate**: Based on the index, I'll identify which specific files or sections are relevant to your question, then navigate to those specific locations.

3. **THIRD - Check Relevant Features**: Reference appropriate documentation in `.ai/features/` as identified by the index:
   - `design-linters.md` - Linting framework and rule system
   - `web-application.md` - Frontend/backend architecture
   - `development-tooling.md` - Build system and automation
   - `claude-integration.md` - AI workflow integration
   - `testing-framework.md` - Quality assurance infrastructure

4. **Reference Standards**: Check `.ai/docs/` for relevant guidelines as indicated by the index:
   - `STANDARDS.md` - Development standards and best practices
   - `FILE_HEADER_STANDARDS.md` - Documentation requirements
   - `CSS_LAYOUT_STABILITY.md` - Frontend guidelines
   - `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Git workflow standards

5. **Examine Implementation**: ONLY after checking the index, look at actual code files for accurate, current information
6. **Consider Templates**: Reference `.ai/templates/` for implementation patterns as directed by the index

**Important**: I will NOT perform generic searches or grep operations before consulting the index. The `.ai/index.json` file is the authoritative navigation guide and MUST be consulted first.
