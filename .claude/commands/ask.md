I'll answer your question about the Durable Code Test project using comprehensive project knowledge.

**Before answering, I will:**

1. **Consult Project Index**: Review `.ai/index.json` for quick navigation and `.ai/index_expanded.md` for comprehensive details
2. **Check Relevant Features**: Reference appropriate documentation in `.ai/features/`:
   - `design-linters.md` - Linting framework and rule system
   - `web-application.md` - Frontend/backend architecture
   - `development-tooling.md` - Build system and automation
   - `claude-integration.md` - AI workflow integration
   - `testing-framework.md` - Quality assurance infrastructure

3. **Reference Standards**: Check `.ai/docs/` for relevant guidelines:
   - `STANDARDS.md` - Development standards and best practices
   - `FILE_HEADER_STANDARDS.md` - Documentation requirements
   - `CSS_LAYOUT_STABILITY.md` - Frontend guidelines
   - `BRANCH_PROTECTION.md` - Git workflow standards

4. **Examine Implementation**: Look at actual code files for accurate, current information
5. **Consider Templates**: Reference `.ai/templates/` for implementation patterns
